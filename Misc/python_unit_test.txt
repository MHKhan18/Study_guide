1) test methods must start with the word "test", e.g. 
		def test_*(self):
				##

2) def setUp(self): 
		##

	and 

   def tearDown(self): 
   		## 
	
   are run before and after every test.



3) @classmethod 
 	def setUpClass(cls):
 		##
 	and

 	@classmethod
 	def tearDownClass(cls):
 		##

 	are run at the start and end of entire test suite.


 4) Mocks:

#) Problems that mocks solve:

i) eliminate dependencies in the class under test
ii) test methods that have no return value
iii) tests error handling
iv) eliminate dependencies on database calls
v) reduce test complexity
vi) don't have to wait to implement other methods

--> patch function in mock library
--> can be used either as decorators or context managers
